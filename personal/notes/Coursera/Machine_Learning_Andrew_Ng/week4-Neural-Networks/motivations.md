# Non-Linear Hypotheses

## Motivating Neural Networks
- Too many features. Depending on polynomial or cubic terms, it's necessary to create every combination with all features to accurately perform logistic regression

# Neurons and the Brain
Initially, neural networks were computationally expensive, but this has since changed.
