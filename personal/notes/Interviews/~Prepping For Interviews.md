## Coding Questions
### Before you start
1. Ask assumptions/clarifications
2. Listen carefully!
3. Draw an example
4. Imagine the brute force answer
5. Question how you would perform the operation on a smaller data set (3 or 4 large)
6. THEN FINALLY IMPLEMENT THE CODE. Notice there are a lot of steps beforehand

### During your code
1. Don't jump in straight away!
2. Implement the core idea first, before focusing on the unnecessary parts. "The main idea"

### After you finish
1. Don't say you're done, there's bugs
2. Time complexities
